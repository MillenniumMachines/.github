# Millennium Machines

We specialise in subtractive manufacturing, and are working to create a robust ecosystem of machines based on open-source values that have been made popular by projects like [Voron Design](https://github.com/voronDesign/).

Our flagship machine is the **Millennium Machines Milo V1.5**, a CNC milling machine that can fit onto any desktop or in any garage, can be built without needing any special tools or expertise, and without breaking the bank.
